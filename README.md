Weather
====================

## Description

This code represents the implementation of a simple web application to show the weather using the World Weather Online API. Whave made this to try the Google Dart language.

The code is divided into four folders. The first three contain different implementations of the client, and the last one contains a simple Django server for it to work.

### Dart Client

* [client-dart](https://github.com/oil-conwet/Weather--DART--Django-/tree/master/client-dart) contains the structured version of the Dart implementation.
* [client-dart_oo](https://github.com/oil-conwet/Weather--DART--Django-/tree/master/client-dart_oo) contains the object oriented version of the Dart implementation along with the tests.
* [client-js_&_jquery](https://github.com/oil-conwet/Weather--DART--Django-/tree/master/client-js_&_jquery) contains both the JavaScript and jQuery versions along with the test we have performed in them.

### Django Server

The folder [django-server](https://github.com/oil-conwet/Weather--DART--Django-/tree/master/django-server) contains all that we have used in the server to test our application. To start it you will need to create a database by using the *python manage.py syncdb* command, then execute *python manage.py runserver*.
